# FocusSpark

The website is hosted for the purpose of keeping the work together and enabling other people to benefit from my articles. FocusSpark is a statically designed website. I will work on launching it as a dynamic website. I integrated my notes, which I prepared using [`Markdown`](https://www.markdownguide.org/) , into my site as an [`.mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) file using the contentlayer infrastructure.

This is a [`Nextjs`](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

npx next start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
